	<h1>Learn How to Code!</h1>

<!-- Introduction -->

	<a name="introduction"/>

	<p>Do you want to learn how to code? Regardless of whether it be for work or pleasure,
	learning how to code is a <strong>fun</strong> and <strong>useful</strong> skill to grow. However there are so many languages
	and styles that it's hard to find out where to start. This page is a lite way to get
	to the starting line and run a few laps. The objective here is to help get your head
	wrapped around the idea that coding is <em>simple</em> and <em>fun</em>!

<!-- STEP 1: Which language to learn! -->
	
	<a name="step1"/>

	<h2>Step 1: Which language to learn?</h2>
	<p>The world of coding is quite diverse and populated. To start, there are a number of
	languages to choose from...PHP, JavaScript (not to be confused with Java), Ruby, HTML,
	Python, and Lua not to mention the <em>C's</em>: C, C++, C#, and Objective-C.</p> 
	
	<p>Each type of language has strength and weaknesses that are determined by the needs of
	the project at hand. In the broadest terms there are layers of coding:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>High Level</li>
		<li>Low Level</li>	
	</ul>
	
	<p><u>High Level</u> language, according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language">
	Wikipedia</a> is a programming language with strong abstraction from the details of the computer.
	In other words higher levels are used to make things that are more software oriented such
	as video games, websites and applications for the iPhone, iPad or computer.</P>
	
	<p><u>Low Level</u> language, according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-level_programming_language">
	Wikipedia</a> is a programming language that provides little or no abstraction from the computer's
	instruction set architecture and generally refers to either machine code or assembly language. Put into
	simpler terms, lower levels are used to make things that are closer to the hardware. This may
	include the software on a microprocessor controlling a robot to the chip in your keyboard
	used to interpret key presses.</p>	
	
	<p>It should be noted that no matter what language you learn first, the second will always be easier
	and the third even more. So don't get too hung up on what the <em>best</em> language is
	and just get started. </p>

<!-- STEP 2: How to get started!-->

	<a name="step2"/>

	<h2>Step 2: How to get started?</h2>
	
	<p>Duh, use the internet! It's free, plentiful and alive! There are countless courses, 
	websites, videos you name it out there in the world wide web. We live in a time that if you
	want to learn something, someone has spent their good time putting together a way for you already.
	Do them and yourselves a favor with a little research. By <em>alive</em> I mean if you have
	a question or topic to discuss there's a site for that too! Search for any question you may
	have whether it be as generic as <em>what does the acronym HTML stand for?</em> or something
	as specific as <em>how do you access nodes of a link list using double pointers?</em> there is
	an answer out there for you. </p>	
	
	<p>Here is a list of some free sites for a few of the most popular languages in use today:</p>
	
	<table cellpadding="5">
